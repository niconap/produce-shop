# Produce Shop

The live version of this project can be found [here](https://produce-shop.onrender.com/store).

## What is it?
This project is a Node.js project. It's supposed to be a shop where someone can buy produce. I used Node.js and Pug to create the website. 
The user can create, delete, and update products and countries of origin if they know the password (the password is "Produce" in the live version). The user can also see all the products and countries of origin (without needing a password). This project is part of The Odin Project's curriculum, the project description can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-inventory-application).

## What is the purpose?
The main goal of this project is making a REST API with all CRUD methods for manipulating the data on the website and using MongoDB to store and fetch that data to display it on the website.
