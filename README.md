# Produce Shop

*Live version:* the live version of this project can be found [here](https://produce-shop.onrender.com/store).

This project is a Node.js project. It's supposed to be a shop where someone can buy produce. I used Node.js and Pug to create the website.
The user can create, delete, and update products and countries of origin if they know the password. They can also see all the products and countries of origin (without needing a password).

Skills shown:
- Using Node.js 
- Using Express 
- Using Pug to make HTML templates
